#_Hello Sam!_
##I guess this is what happens when you change the filetype to markdown. 

* First, I would like to point out that there is a great markdow cheatsheet at this [link](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).
* Second, I am not sure why the previous edits are showing up above. 
* Third, my hope is that I will submit this as a pull request and you will reject it, so that I can see what that is like.
